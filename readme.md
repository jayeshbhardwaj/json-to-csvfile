# Library/Utility for JSON to CSV parsing!

## Usage
You can use `lein run <inp_path> <out_path>` to use it from cli or you can invoke it from main

``` clojure
(-main <input_jsonpath> <output_csvpath>)
```

### Library
We can also use this as a library, as both `json-to-csv` and `vectorize` are reusable functions
